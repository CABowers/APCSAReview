Free Response - Tile Game B
===========================

The following is a free response question from 2009.  It was question 1 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 1.**  A game uses square tiles that have numbers on their sides. Each tile is labeled with a number on each of its four sides and may be rotated clockwise, as illustrated below.

.. figure:: Figures/tileGameDiagram.png

    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

The tiles are represented by the ``NumberTile`` class, as given below.

.. code-block:: java

   public class NumberTile
   {
    /** Rotates the tile 90 degrees clockwise
     */
    public void rotate()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** @return value at left edge of tile
     */
    public int getLeft()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    /** @return value at right edge of file
     */
    public int getRight()
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
   }

Tiles are placed on a game board so that the adjoining sides of adjacent tiles have the same number. The
following figure illustrates an arrangement of tiles and shows a new tile that is to be placed on the game board.

.. figure:: Figures/tileGameDiagram2.png
    :width: 607px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

In its original orientation, the new tile can be inserted between the tiles at positions 2 and 3 or between the tiles
at positions 3 and 4. If the new tile is rotated once, it can be inserted before the tile at position 0 (the first tile) or
after the tile at position 4 (the last tile). Assume that the new tile, in its original orientation, is inserted between
the tiles at positions 2 and 3. As a result of the insertion, the tiles at positions 3 and 4 are moved one location to
the right, and the new tile is inserted at position 3, as shown below.

A partial definition of the ``TileGame`` class is given below.

.. code-block:: java

   public class TileGame
   {
    /** represents the game; guaranteed never to be null */
    private ArrayList<NumberTile> board;

    public TileGame()
    { board = new ArrayList<NumberTile>(); }

    /** Determines where to insert title, in its current orientation, into game board
     *  @param tile the tile to be placed on the game board
     *  @return the position of tile where tile is to be inserted:
     *          0 if the board is empty;
     *         -1 if tile does not fit in front, at end,
     *            or between any existing files;
     *         otherwise, 0 <= position returned <= board.size()
     */
    private int getIndexForFit(NumberTile tile)
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    /** Places tile on the game board if it fits
     *  (checking all possible tile orientations if necessary).
     *  If there are no tiles on the game board, the tile is placed at position 0.
     *  The tile should be placed at most 1 time.
     *  Precondition: board is not null
     *  @param tile the tile to be placed on the game board
     *  @return true if tile is placed successfully; false otherwise
     *  Postcondition: the orientations of the other tiles
     *                 on the board are not changed
     *  Postcondition: the order of the other tiles on the board relative to each
     *                 other is not changed
     */
    public boolean insertTile(NumberTile tile)
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
   }

**Part b.**
Write the ``TileGame`` method ``insertTile`` that attempts to insert the given tile on the game board.
The method returns ``true`` if the tile is inserted successfully and ``false`` only if the tile cannot be placed
on the board in any orientation.

How to Solve This
--------------------
1. You will need to check to see if the given tile will fit in the game board without rotating it.
2. If the tile doesn't fit initially, you will need to repeatedly check whether it will fit after rotation. What type of loop will you use?
3. Remember that you will need to return a value to the calling method. How will you determine this value?

The Algorithm
-------------------
.. parsonsprob:: TileGameB

  The method insertTile below contains the correct code for one solution to this problem, but it is mixed up and contains extra blocks that are not needed.  Drag the needed code from the left to the right and put them in order with the correct indention so that the code would work correctly.
  -----
  public boolean insertTile(NumberTile tile) {
  =====
     int index = getIndexForFit(tile);
     int test = 1;
  =====
     while (index == -1 && test < 4) {
  =====
        tile.rotate();
        index = getIndexForFit(tile);
        test++;
  =====
     } // end while
     if (index != -1)
        this.board.add(index, tile);
  =====
     return (index != -1);
  =====
  } // end method

Solve Part B
------------

Complete the method ``insertTile`` below.
Assume that ``getIndexForFit`` works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (a).
